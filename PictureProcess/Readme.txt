This projct is written by Kui Yang based on Opencv 3.2(I can't remember which version I was using then)
The code may be a mess for because that's what I wrote 3 years ago.
But it works well.
The Data folder is where the input in. All inputs are pictures that have different exposure or other feature but have similar contents.
The refs folder is the paper I read.
My job is to combine them and generate a better one.
